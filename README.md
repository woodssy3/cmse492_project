# Air Quality Prediction Project

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze air quality data across various cities from 2017 to 2022. Our goal is to identify patterns and predict future pollution levels based on multiple factors, including weather conditions, traffic patterns, and industrial activities.

## Objectives
- Analyze air quality datasets to uncover hidden trends.
- Develop predictive models using machine learning.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and accuracy.
- Provide actionable insights for policymakers to improve air quality management.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/woodssy3/cmse492_project
cd air-quality-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
